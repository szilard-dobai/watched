description: Run quick quality checks (lint, type-check, and tests)
---

Run the following quality checks:

1. Run ESLint to check for code quality issues
2. Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
3. Run tests to ensure all tests pass

Execute: `npm run check`

After running the checks, report any errors or warnings found. If there are errors, offer to fix them.
